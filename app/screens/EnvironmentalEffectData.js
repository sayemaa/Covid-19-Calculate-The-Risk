    question: "Does climate change affect the transmission of coronavirus ?",
    answers: [
      "Although there is no direct evidence linking climate change to the spread of COVID-19, it has been hypothesized that its effects on our health and the risk for infections are real.",
      "As the Earth warms, many animals are traveling to the poles to escape the heat. This phenomenon has the potential to introduce pathogens to new hosts.",
      "Climate change is considered one of the main factors that increase the risk of pandemics. Habitat loss increases the frequency of infectious diseases among animals and humans.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Does air pollution increase the risk of getting coronavirus ?",
    answers: [
      "Recent research shows that air quality is associated with a higher risk of dying from COVID-19 even when taking into account other factors that can affect the risk of death.",
      "This study is consistent with previous studies that have shown that people who smoke and are exposed to air pollution are more prone to suffering from respiratory infections than those who don’t smoke.",
      "We also have to pay attention to the individuals who are most vulnerable to air pollution. These include the homeless, those with chronic health conditions, and those who have no air filtration in their homes.",
    ],

  {
    question:
      "How likely are we to see infectious diseases spread as a result of climate change ?",
    answers: [
      "Climate change has made conditions more favorable for the spread of pathogens that can cause illnesses such as Lyme disease and malaria. These diseases can also be triggered by various factors such as temperature and rainfall patterns. To limit the risk of infectious diseases, greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "Will warmer weather slow the spread of coronavirus ?",
    answers: [
      "Although we don’t yet know what the weather will bring, we should not rely on warm weather to curtail the spread of COVID-19.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "What actions can we take to prevent future outbreaks ?",
    answers: [
      "To avoid the next epidemic, we must also take climate action. Preventing deforestation, for example, can help reduce biodiversity loss and slow animal migrations, both of which can raise the risk of infectious disease spread.",
    ],
  },
